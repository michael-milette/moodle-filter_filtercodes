# Basic Overview

FilterCodes filter for Moodle enables content creators to easily customize
and personalize site and course content using plain text tags.

In addition, it also enables you to:
* Inserting non-breaking spaces;
* Tagging text as being in a different language;

Usage of the FilterCodes tags requires no knowledge of HTML but might be
important for sites wishing to comply with accessibility requirements.

IMPORTANT: This STABLE release has been tested on many Moodle sites. Although we expect everything to work, if you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

HOWEVER: There may be some tags identified as ALPHA in this documentation. These may still require some development and are not guarantied to be implementaed or implemented in the same way in future releases. Please let us know if you think they are useful if they work for you or what changes you might like to see.

### HTML and "lang" tagging

* {-} : Is substituted for &shy;, a soft hyphen that only appears when needed.
* {nbsp} : Is substituted for a non-breaking space when displayed.
* {langx xx}{/langx} : Tag specific text in a particular language by wrapping the text in a plain text pair of {langx xx} {/langx} or {langx xx-XX} {/langx} tags. This makes no visible changes to the content but wraps the content in an HTML <span lang="xx"></span> inline tag. As a result, screen readers will make use of this localization information to apply a particular pronunciation if the text is in a different language than the language of the rest of the page. This is required for compliance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)
* {details}{summary}{/summary}{/details} : An easy way to create an HTML 5 Details/Summary expandable section in your page. IMPORTANT: {details}{summary}{/summary} must all be on one line (it is ok if the line wraps). The rest of the details can be on multiple lines followed by the {/details}. This is an experimental feature which may result in invalid HTML but it works.

The opening {langx xx} tag should include two [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code abbreviation letters in lowercase associated with language's name. French, for example, has the code **fr**:

    {langx fr}Contenu{/langx}

The {langx fr}{/langx} filter will convert this into the following HTML

    <span lang="fr">Contenu</span>

The opening {langx xx} may also include a [culture code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation) used in countries and regions. This includes an additional dash and two uppercase letters associated with language's region or country. French Canadian, for example, has the code **fr-CA**:

    {langx fr-CA}Contenu{/langx}

The {langx fr-CA}{/langx} filter will convert this into the following HTML

    <span lang="fr-CA">Contenu</span>

## FilterCodes in a custom menu

Here are a couple of examples of how to create really useful custom menus using FilterCodes. Just copy and paste the code into the **Custom menu items** field (Site administration > Appearance > Theme settings)

Feel free to customize these for your own needs and to make more of these for other roles like Course creators, Teachers, Teacher assistants and even Students.

**Doesn't work?** If FilterCodes doesn't work with your theme's custom menu, contact the developer / maintainer of the theme and refer them to the [FAQ](#faq) section of this documentation which will provide them with an easy way for them to enable support for Moodle filters.

### General menu

This will add a Home link, a listing of categories, a listing of courses in which you are currently enrolled, and a Logout link, but only if you are currently logged in.

    Home|\
    Course catalogue
    {categoriesmenu}
    {ifloggedin}
    My Courses
    {mycoursesmenu}
    Logout|/login/logout.php?sesskey={sesskey}
    {/ifloggedin}

### Admin menu

This menu can be handy for Moodle administrators and managers.

    {ifminmanager}
    Admin
    {ifadmin}
    -Moodle Settings
    --Additional HTML|/admin/settings.php?section=additionalhtml
    --Advanced features|/admin/settings.php?section=optionalsubsystems
    --Frontpage|/admin/settings.php?section=frontpagesettings
    --Notifications|/admin/index.php
    --Plugin overview|/admin/plugins.php
    --Profile fields|/user/profile/index.php
    --Support contact|/admin/settings.php?section=supportcontact
    --Theme settings|/admin/settings.php?section=themesettings
    -Install
    --Plugin|https://moodle.org/plugins
    --Theme|https://moodle.org/plugins/browse.php?list=category&id=3
    {/ifadmin}
    -This course
    --Turn editing on|/course/view.php?id={courseid}&sesskey={sesskey}&edit=on
    --Course Backup|/backup/backup.php?id={courseid}
    --Enrolled users|/enrol/users.php?id={courseid}
    --Manage badges|/badges/index.php?type={courseid}
    --Reset course|/course/reset.php?id={courseid}
    -Add new course|/course/edit.php?category={categoryid}&returnto=topcat
    -Course management|/course/management.php
    -Restore Course|/backup/restorefile.php?contextid={coursecontextid}
    -System reports|/admin/category.php?category=reports
    {ifminsitemanager}
    -User management|/admin/user.php
    {/ifminsitemanager}
    -###
    -Moodle support|https://moodle.org/course/view.php?id=5
    {/ifminmanager}

In this extensive example, part of the custom menu will appear only to users with a manager role while everything will appear to administrators. Nothing will appear for everyone else.

### Developer menu

If you are a developer, this little menu is worth installing FilterCodes alone.

Together with the Administration menu above, these can be a real productivity boost for developers who are tired of always digging through the **Site administration** block to find the options they are looking for. Tailor it to your particular projects with links to any page you need regularly:

    {ifdev}
    Dev tools
    -Configure debugging|/admin/settings.php?section=debugging
    -Code checker|/local/codechecker
    -Moodle PHPdoc check|/local/moodlecheck
    -Purge cache|/admin/purgecaches.php?confirm=1&sesskey={sesskey}
    -###
    -Adminer|/local/local/adminer
    -PHP Info|/admin/phpinfo.php
    -###
    -Developer docs|https://moodle.org/development
    -Developer forum|https://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=55
    -Tracker|https://tracker.moodle.org/
    -AMOS|https://lang.moodle.org/
    {/ifdev}

Tip: Are you a theme developers? Add a direct link to your theme's settings page.

Notes:

- **Enrolled users**, in the **This course** submenu, will only work in a course.
- **[Code checker](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_codechecker)**, **[Moodle PHPdoc check](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_moodlecheck)** and [Moodle Adminer](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_adminer) require add-on 3rd party plugins which need to be installed in order for the links to work.

## Scrape'ing content

Note: This feature must be enabled in FilterCodes settings.

As of version 0.4.7, you can now use FileterCodes to scrape content from another web page. Your mileage may vary and depends a lot on your configuration, the website from which you are scraping content and more.

{scrape url="..." tag="..." class="..." id="..." code="..."}

Tip: When adding this tag in one of Moodle's WYSIWYG editors like Atto or TinyMCE, the tag may end up embedded in a set of HTML paragraph tags. If this happens, the content you are scraping may not result in valid HTML. To fix the problem, you will need to go into the source code view of the editor and replace the P (paragraph) tags with div and then save. Alternatively, if there is nothing else in the editor, you can remove everything before and after the tag and save.

Parameters:

* url = The URL of the webpage from which you want to grab its content.
* tag = The HTML tag you want to capture.
* class = Optional. Default is blank (class is irrelevant). Class attribute of the HTML tag you want to capture. Must be an exact match for everything between the quotation marks.
* id = Optional. Default is blank (id is irrelevant). id tag of the HTML tag you want to capture.
* code = Optional. Default is blank (no code). This is URL encoded code that you want to insert after the content. Will be decoded before being inserted into the page. Can be things like JavaScript for example. Be careful with this one. If not encoded, will result in error.

If the URL fails to produce any content (broken link for example), a message will be displayed on the page encouraging the visitor to contact the webmaster. This message can be customized through the Moodle Language editor.

If a matching tag, class and/or id can't be found, will return all of the page content without being filtered.

## Back to section / Back to course

Help students navigate your Moodle site by implementing this handy-dandy BACK button. Works at both the section and activity level.

    <p style="float:right;"><a href="{wwwroot}/course/view.php?id={courseid}&amp;section={sectionid}" class="btn btn-outline" style="font-size:14px;">Go Back</a></p>

If you are in a section and want to go directly back to the main course outline but scroll down to the current section, try this:

    <p style="float:right;"><a href="{wwwroot}/course/view.php?id={courseid}#section-{sectionid}" class="btn btn-outline" style="font-size:14px;">Back to course outline</a></p>

## Optional FilterCodes for Moodle settings

FilterCodes for Moodle includes the following settings. These are available on the plugin's `Settings` page by going to:

Site administration > Plugins > Filters > Filter Codes

### Custom navigation support

Experimental: Enable support for FilterCode tags in Moodle custom navigation menu. Note: Is known to be compatible with Clean and Boost based themes.

NOTE: Does not filter tags on the Moodle Theme Settings page. This is not a bug. It is just the way it has to be for now.

### Scrape tag support

Enable or disable the {scrape} tag.

* The {langx xx}{/langx} tag only supports inline text, not blocks of text.
* Unpredictable results may occur if you interweave HTML code with {FilterCodesTag} tags.

Incorrect example:

    <strong>{FilterCodesTag}Content</strong>{/FilterCodesTag}

Correct example:

    {FilterCodesTag}<strong>Content</strong>{/FilterCodeTag}

# Language Support

This plugin includes support for the English language.

If you need a different language that is not yet supported, please feel free to contribute using the Moodle AMOS Translation Toolkit for Moodle at

https://lang.moodle.org/

If the content replacing the tag contains language filtering tags, be sure to have FilterCodes above the language filter in the Moodle filter settings.

This plugin has not been tested for right-to-left (RTL) language support. If you want to use this plugin with a RTL language and it doesn't work as-is, feel free to prepare a pull request and submit it to the project page at:

# FAQ

## Frequently Asked Questions

IMPORANT: Although we expect everything to work, this release has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

### Troubleshooting: Why are tags displayed as entered instead of being converted to expected content/data?

Here are a few things you can check:

* Make sure the plugin is enabled (**On**) for both **Headings and Content** in Site Administration > Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters. See installation instructions.
* Make sure that the tag you are trying to use is supported in the version of FilterCodes you currently have installed on your Moodle site. See the CHANGELOG.md for the history of when tags were added.
* Try testing using the {firstname} tag. It was one of the very first (it's not even in the history). If it works with this tags, it should work with others.
* Make sure you specified any required parameters in your tag. In the case of the {langx} tag for example, make sure you included the 2 letter language code in the opening tag. Example: {langx fr}.
* If the tags required a closing tag, make sure that it includes a forward slash and does not include any parameters. Example: {/ifenrolled}.
* If the tag requires a closing tag, Make sure that the closing tag does not contain any parameters. Only opening tags may contain parameters.
* If it doesn't work with a particular 3rd party theme (i.e. not included with Moodle), try it using it in the Boost theme.
* If it doesn't work with a particular 3rd party plugin (i.e. not included with Moodle), try using the tag in an HTML block or label.
* If you have determined that the problem is with a 3rd party plugin or theme, please report the issue to its developer using the **Bug Tracker** link on the plugin's page located at moodle.org/plugins. Provide as much information as you can. It may be helpful to point them to the [Moodle Output API documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Output_functions), specifically the format_text() and format_string() functions.
* If it still doesn't work, chances are that this some part of Moodle doesn't support filters yet. It is rare but it happens (example: Badges). Please report the part of Moodle that doesn't support filters in the [Moodle Tracker](https://tracker.moodle.org).
* Read the rest of this FAQ section.
* If all else fails, ask questions. There are links on the [FilterCodes](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_filtercodes) plugin page to the [Discussion](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=359252) forum for getting help and the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues) on GitHub for reporting bugs.

### Can I combine/nest conditional tags?

Yes. You can only combine (AND) them. The two or more tags must be true in order for the content to be displayed. For example:

{ifloggedin}{ifenrolled}You are logged-in and enrolled in this course.{/ifenrolled}{/ifloggedin}

This plugin does not support {IF this OR that} type conditions at this time. Depending on your requirement, the {ifmin...} tags might help you achieve this. These tags enable you to display content to users with a minimum role level. This could be useful if you wanted to only display a message to faculty such as (teacher or above).

### I am using FilterCodes on a multi-language site. Some of my non-FilterCode tags are not being processed. How can I fix this?

This is actually a pretty common question. Simply move FilterCodes to the top of the list in your Moodle Filter Management. The only exception to this would be if one of your other filters were generating content that included FilterCode tags. In that case, place that plugin above FilterCodes.

### How can I use this to pre-populate one or more fields in a Contact Form for Moodle?

Just put the tag in the input's value parameter. Here are a couple of examples:

    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" value="{email}">
    <input id="name" name="name" type="text" required="required" value="{fullname}">

Pro Tip: You can pre-populate a field and make it non-editable for logged-in users using a conditional tag:

    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" {ifloggedin}readonly{/ifloggedin} value="{email}">
    <input id="name" name="name" type="text" required="required" {ifloggedin}readonly{/ifloggedin} value="{fullname}">

### Why do administrators see the text of all other roles when using {ifminxxxx}Content{/ifminxxxx} tags?

This is normal as the administrator has the permission of all other roles. The {ifmin...} tags will display content if the user has a minimum of the specified role or above. For example, {ifminteacher}Content here!{/ifminteacher} will display "Content here!" whether the user is a teacher, course creator, manager or administrator even if they are not a teacher.

### Is there a tag to display...?

Only the tags listed in this [documentation](#usage) are currently supported (version on GitHub is often newer than on Moodle.org). We are happy to add new functionality in future releases of FilterCodes. Please post all requests in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues). You'll also find a link for this on the plugin's page. The subject line should start with "Feature Request: ".

When requesting a new tag, please provide:

* As much detail as possible on what you are trying to accomplish.
* An example of how it would be used.
* If possible, where in Moodle the information would come from.

Be sure to check back on your issue as we may have further questions for you.

### Do you have examples, samples and ways to which tags are working in my version of FilterCodes?

You can switch to different roles to see how each will affect the content being displayed.

### When a user is logged out, the First name, Surname, Full Name, Email address and Username are empty. How can I set default values for these tags?

You can do this using the language editor built into Moodle. There is currently support for the following defaults: defaultfirstname, defaultsurname, defaultusername, defaultemail. By default, these are blank. As for the Full Name, it is made up of the first name and surname separated by a space and is therefore not settable.

### I added the "{mycoursesmenu}" to my custom menu. How can I hide it if the user is not logged in?

You can use the {ifloggedin}{/ifloggedin} tags to conditionally hide it when users are not logged in. Example:

{ifloggedin}My Courses
{mycoursesmenu}{/ifloggedin}

### How can I add a "Logout" link in my custom menu?

Just add the following line to your custom menu (under Appearance > Theme settings)

{ifloggedin}Logout|/login/logout.php?sesskey={sesskey}{/ifloggedin}

Bonus: This is also how you would hide it for users who are not logged-in.

### How can I create a menu that is just for administrators or some other roles?

Building on the previous two questions, see the [usage](#usage) section for some examples. Feel free to share your own ideas in the discussion forum.

### Can I use FilterCodes in Moodle's custom menus?

Technically for sure, but only if the theme supports it. If it doesn't, contact the theme's developer and request that they add support for Moodle filters. See instructions in the next question.

**Note:** As of version 1.0.0 of FilterCodes, experimental support was added for Clean and Boost themes in Moodle 3.2 to 3.4. In order to work, this had to be enabled in FilterCodes settings and Filtering will not be applied to the Moodle Theme Settings page. Unfortunately things changed in Moodle 3.5 and it has since not been possible for FilterCodes to do this on its own.

However, there are two ways you can make this work.

1. Encourage Moodle HQ to enable this functionality into future versions of Moodle. For more information and to vote for this functionality, see
   https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues/67 .
2. Encourage developers to enable this in their themes or add it yourself. See the next question for details.

### I am a Moodle theme developer. How do I add support for Moodle filters, including FilterCodes, into my theme?

You will need to pass all output (except user content) through the format_text() or format_string() functions of the [Moodle Output API documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Output_functions).

### I am a Moodle theme developer. How do I add support for FilterCodes in the Custom Menu?

#### For themes based on **boost**

Add the following code to core_renderer section of your theme. Note: Your theme may even already have such a class (they often do):

    use filter_manager;

    class core_renderer extends \theme_boost\output\core_renderer {
        /**
         * Applies Moodle filters to custom menu and custom user menu.
         *
         * @param string $custommenuitems Current custom menu object.
         * @return Rendered custom_menu that has been filtered.
         */

            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $filteroptions = array('originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true);
            $skipfilters = array('activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters');

            // Filter custom user menu.
            // Don't filter custom user menu on the settings page. Otherwise it ends up
            // filtering the edit field itself resulting in a loss of the tag.
            if ($PAGE->pagetype != 'admin-setting-themesettings' && stripos($CFG->customusermenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $CFG->customusermenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($CFG->customusermenuitems, $PAGE->context,
                        $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }

            // Filter custom menu.
            if (empty($custommenuitems) && !empty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;
            }
            if (stripos($custommenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $PAGE->context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }
            $custommenu = new custom_menu($custommenuitems, current_language());
            return $this->render_custom_menu($custommenu);
        }

        /**
         * We want to show the custom menus as a list of links in the footer on small screens.
         * Just return the menu object exported so we can render it differently.
         */
        public function custom_menu_flat() {
            global $CFG, $PAGE;
            $custommenuitems = '';

            }

            return $custommenu->export_for_template($this);
        }
    }

#### For themes based on the older **bootstrapbase**

Add the following code to core_renderer section of your theme for Moodle 2.7 to 3.6. Be sure to replace "themename" with the name of the theme's directory. Note: Your theme may even already have such a class (they often do):

    class theme_themename_core_renderer extends theme_bootstrapbase_core_renderer {
        /**
         * Applies Moodle filters to custom menu and custom user menu.
         *
         * Copyright: 2017-2020 TNG Consulting Inc.
         * License:   GNU GPL v3+.
         *
         * @param string $custommenuitems Current custom menu object.
         * @return Rendered custom_menu that has been filtered.
         */
        public function custom_menu($custommenuitems = '') {
            global $CFG, $PAGE;

            // Don't apply auto-linking filters.
            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $filteroptions = array('originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true);
            $skipfilters = array('activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters');

            // Filter custom user menu.
            // Don't filter custom user menu on the theme settings page. Otherwise it ends up
            // filtering the edit field itself resulting in a loss of tags.
            if ($PAGE->pagetype != 'admin-setting-themesettings' && stripos($CFG->customusermenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $CFG->customusermenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($CFG->customusermenuitems, $PAGE->context,
                        $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }

            // Filter custom menu.
            if (empty($custommenuitems) && !emty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;
            }
            if (stripos($custommenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $PAGE->context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }
            $custommenu = new custom_menu($custommenuitems, current_language());
            return $this->render_custom_menu($custommenu);
        }
    }

### My theme does not support filters in the menu and the developer does not want to fix the theme. What can I do?

You can patch Moodle handle this properly in the first place. Applying the following patch to Moodle will fix the issue in most themes including the default Boost theme.

* Moodle 3.7: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M37
* Moodle 3.8: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M38
* Moodle 3.9: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M39
* Moodle 3.10: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M310

### Why is the IP Address listed as 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1?

0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 is the same as localhost and it means that your web browser is probably on the same computer as your web server. This shouldn't happen with users accessing your Moodle site from their own desktop or mobile device.

### Why does it show me as enrolled on the front page?

The Front Page is a course in Moodle. All users are enrolled by default in this course.

### I added the {recaptcha} tag in my web form. Why doesn't the reCAPTCHA show up?

First, the reCAPTCHA is only made to work with forms processed by the Contact Form for Moodle plugin. That said, it is 100% generated by Moodle API so, if you have some other purpose, it will probably work as well as long as the receiving form is made to process it.

In order for reCAPTCHA to work, you need to configure the site and secret keys in Moodle. For more information, log into your Moodle site as an Administrator and the navigate to Home > Site Administration > Authentication > Manage Authentication and configure the ReCAPTCHA site key and ReCAPTCHA secret key. You will also need to enable ReCAPTCHA in the settings of the Contact Form plugin.

If you are using older versions of Moodle before 3.1.11+, 3.2.8+, 3.3.5+, 3.4.5+ and 3.5+, ReCAPTCHA is no longer supported.

### How can I get the {scrape} tag to work?

You need to enable this feature in the FilterCodes settings in Moodle.

### How can I scrape content from more than one web page or more than one website?

Use multiple {scrape} tags.

### How can I scrape content based on a pattern of HTML tags instead of just one HTML tag with a class or id? Example, an h1 tag inside the div class="content" tag.

That is not possible at this time. This is a very simple scraper. With some funding or contributions, this feature can be enhanced.

### How can I get the {getstring} tag to work? It doesn't seem to be replaced with the correct text.

Verify that the component (plugin) name and/or the string key are correct. If a component name is not specified, it will default to "moodle". If you recently modified a language file manually in Moodle, you may need to refresh the Moodle cache.

### How can I customize or translate the forms generated by the {form...} tags?

You can translate or customize the forms in Moodle's language editor. Note that using these tags are optional. You can also simply insert the HTML for the form in the Atto editor. These {form...} tags are just provided to quickly create generic forms on your Moodle site.

### What are the Supported dateTimeFormat formats?

The date and time formats, defined in Moodle (langconfig.php)[https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/lang/en/langconfig.php], control how dates and times will be displayed.

At this time, only the following formats are supported:

* backupnameformat
* strftimedate
* strftimedatemonthabbr
* strftimedatefullshort
* strftimedateshort
* strftimedateshortmonthabbr
* strftimedatetime
* strftimedaydate
* strftimedaydatetime
* strftimedayshort
* strftimedaytime
* strftimemonthyear
* strftimerecent
* strftimerecentfull
* strftimetime
* strftimetime12
* strftimetime24

Note: the displayed date and/or time format can vary depending on the language pack in use. While you can customize these using the Moodle language customization tool included with Moodle, be aware that this will have affect displayed dates that use the modified format throughout your Moodle site. Pro tip: Standardize the date format used throughout your site as much as possible in order to minimize the chance of potentially confusing your learners.

ALPHA WARNING: You may discover that you can also use (strftime)[https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php] formats. However, in some situations, strftime may produce undesirable results - missing unrelated content in your page for example. The strftime formats are officially unsupported at this time. This is a known issue and is not recommended at this time. Please do not report issues with it. Use strftime formats at your own risk.

### Are there any security considerations?

There are no known security considerations at this time.
