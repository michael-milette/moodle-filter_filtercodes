# Basic Overview

FilterCodes filter for Moodle enables content creators to easily customize and personalize Moodle sites and course content using over 135 plain text tags that can be used **almost** anywhere in Moodle. Support may also vary depending on the theme used.

In addition, it also enables you to:

* Add user interface (UI) elements
* Inserting non-breaking spaces;
* Tagging text as being in a different language;

Usage of the FilterCodes tags requires no knowledge of HTML but could be important for sites wishing to comply with accessibility requirements.

**IMPORTANT**: This STABLE release has been tested on many Moodle sites. Although we expect everything to work, if you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

**ALPHA TAGS**: There may be some tags identified as ALPHA in this documentation. These may still require some development and are not guaranteed to be implemented at all or implemented in the same way in future releases. Please let us know if you think they are useful if they work for you or what changes you might like to see.

* {thisurl} : The complete URL of the current page.
* {thisurl_enc} : The complete encoded URL of the current page.
* {urlencode}{/urlencode} : URL encodes any content between the tages.
* {rawurlencode}{/rawurlencode} : URL encodes any content between the tages according to RFC 3986.

* {ipaddress} : User's IP Address.
* {sesskey} or %7Bsesskey%7D : Moodle session key.
* {wwwcontactform} : Action URL for Contact Form forms. (requires Contact Form plugin).

### Content

* {global_...} : Use your own custom FilterCodes tags in the filter's settings. These are sometimes referred to as global blocks. An example of this might be if you wanted to define a standardized copyright or other text, form, email address, website URL, phone number, name, link, support information and more. Define and centrally manage up to 100 global block tags.
* {note}content{/note} : Enables you to include a note which will not be displayed.
* {help}content{/help} : Enables you to create popup help icons just like Moodle does.
* {info}content{/info} : Enables you to create popup help icons just like the popup Help icons but with an "i" information icon.
* (ALPHA) {alert style}content{/alert} : Creates an alert box containing the specified content. You can change the style by specifying an optional parameter. Example: **{alert primary}** or **{alert success}**. [List of styles](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/alerts/). In addition, you can also specify **{alert border}** which will simply put a border around your content. This cannot be combined with other styles.
* {highlight}{/highlight} : Highlight text like a highlighter in bright yellow. NOTE: Must only be used within a paragraph.
* {marktext}{/marktext} : Highlight text using HTML5's mark tag. You can style this tag using CSS in your theme using a fc-marktext class.
* {markborder}{/markborder} : Surrounds text with a red dashed border. You can style this tag using CSS in your theme using a fc-markborder class (border and padding with !important to override).
* {scrape url="..." tag="..." class="..." id="..." code="..."} : Scrapes the content from another web page. Must be enabled in FilterCodes settings.
* {getstring:component_name}stringidentifier{/getstring} or {getstring}stringidentifier{/getstring}: Display a Moodle language string in the current language. If no component name (plugin) is specified, will default to "moodle".
* {fa/fas/fab/fa-solid/fa-brands fa-...} : Insert FontAwesome icon. Note: FontAwesome Font/CSS must be loaded as part of your theme. Supports FontAwesome 4.x and 6.0 included with Moodle. If you have the pro version installed, it the additional icons will be supported as well.
* {glyphicon glyphicon-...} : Insert Glyphicons icon. Note: Glyphicons Font/CSS must be loaded as part of your theme.

### Contact Form templates

The following tags are replaced by Contact Form templates and therefore require that you have the Contact Form for Moodle plugin installed.

* {formquickquestion} : Adds a "quick question" form to your course. The form includes Subject and Message fields. Note: The user must be logged in or the form will not be displayed.
* {formcontactus} : Adds a "Contact Us" form to your site (example: in a page). The form fields include Name, Email address, Subject and Message fields.
* {formcourserequest} : Adds a "Course Request" form to your site (example: in a page). Unlike Moodle's request-a-course feature where you can request to create your own course, this tag allows users to request that a new course, which would be of interest to them, be created. Could also be used to submit a request to take a course. The form fields includes Name, Email address, Course name, Course Description.
* {formsupport} : Adds a "Support Request" form to your site (example: in a page). The form fields include Name, Email address, pre-determined Subject, specific Subject, URL and Message fields.
* {formcheckin} : Adds an "I'm here!" button to your course. The form does not include any fields. Note: The user must be logged in or the button will not be displayed.

### Useful for creating Custom Contact Forms and Links

* {lang} : 2-letter language code of current Moodle language.
* {recaptcha} : Display the ReCAPTCHA field - for use with Contact Form for Moodle. Note: It will be blank if the user is logged in using a non-guest account.
* {readonly} : To be used within form input fields to make them read-only if the user is logged in.
* {editingtoggle} : "off" if in edit page mode. Otherwise "on". Useful for creating Turn Editing On/Off links.
* {wwwcontactform} : Action URL for Contact Form forms. (requires Contact Form plugin).
* {formsesskey} : Not a form. This can be used instead of having to insert the required hidden input field and JavaScript Snippet.

### Conditionally display content filters (All versions of Moodle)

Note: {if*rolename*} and {ifmin*rolename*} type tags are based on role archetypes, not role shortnames. For example, you could have a role called *students* but, if the archetype for the role is *teacher*, the role will be identified as a *teacher*. Roles that not based on archetypes will not work with these tags.

#### Logged in/out

In such cases, you will need to manually edit and correct the IDs in the tags to reflect the new activity id numbers to restore their functionality.
* {ifnotactivitycompleted id}{/ifnotactivitycompleted} : Will only display the content if the activity module specified by the id (see the activity's URL id=value), has NOT been completed. Requires that completion be enabled for the site, the course and configured in the specified activity. Note: Activity IDs change when you copy or restore a course.

Note: The **shortname** for {ifprofile **shortname**...} tags can be any visible custom profile fields, unless the FilterCodes ifprofilefiedonlyvisible setting is unchecked, as well as the core 'id', 'username', 'auth', 'idnumber', 'email', 'institution', 'department', 'city', 'country', 'timezone', or 'lang' core profile fields.

If the condition is not met in the particular context, the specified tag and its content will be removed.

#### Conditionally display content filters (For Moodle Mobile app and Web services)
* {ifmobile}{/ifmobile} : Will display content if accessed from a web service such as the Moodle mobile app.
* {ifnotmobile}{/ifnotmobile} : Will display content if not accessed from a web service such as a web browser.
#### Conditionally display content filters (For Moodle Workplace)

* (BETA) {iftenant idnumber|tenantid}{/iftenant} : Will display the content if a tenant idnumber or tenant id is specified. Only {iftenant 1} will work in Moodle classic.
* (BETA) {ifworkplace}{/ifworkplace} : Will display the content only if displayed in Moodle Workplace.

### HTML and "lang" tagging

* {-} : Is substituted for &shy;, a soft hyphen that only appears when needed.
* {nbsp} : Is substituted for a non-breaking space when displayed.
* {hr} : Horizontal rule.
* {details}{summary}{/summary}{/details} : An easy way to create an HTML 5 Details/Summary expandable section in your page. IMPORTANT: {details}{summary}{/summary} must all be on one line (it is ok if the line wraps). The rest of the details can be on multiple lines followed by the {/details}. This is an experimental feature that may result in invalid HTML but it works. You can optionally add a CSS class name to the opening details tag. Example: {details faq-class}
* {multilang xx}{/multilang} : Tags text so it displays only when the user interface is set to that particular language. For example, use {multilang en}English{/multilang}{multilang fr}Français{/multilang} to display ‘English’ when the UI is in English and ‘Français’ when it’s in French. Please be aware that this method does not actually perform language filtering. It merely simplifies the usage of Moodle’s **Multi-Language Content** filter. If this filter is activated, it will convert these plain text tags into HTML span tags, which are then processed by the **Multi-Language Content** filter. This only works if the Multi-Language Content filter is listed below the FilterCodes filter in ‘ Site Administration > Plugins > Filters > Manage filters’. When the content displayed, if you see the content for all languages, it is because you did not enable the Multi-Language Content filter.
* {langx xx}{/langx} : Tag specific text in a particular language by wrapping the text in a plain text pair of {langx xx} {/langx} or {langx xx-XX} {/langx} tags. This makes no visible changes to the content but wraps the content in an HTML <span lang="xx"></span> inline tag. As a result, screen readers will make use of this localization information to apply a particular pronunciation if the text is in a different language than the language of the rest of the page. This is required for compliance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)

The opening {langx xx} tag should include two [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code abbreviation letters in lowercase associated with the language's name. French, for example, has the code **fr**:

    {langx fr}Contenu{/langx}

The {langx fr}{/langx} filter will convert this into the following HTML

```html
    <span lang="fr">Contenu</span>
```

The opening {langx xx} may also include a [culture code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation) used in countries and regions. This includes an additional dash and two uppercase letters associated with the language's region or country. French Canadian, for example, has the code **fr-CA**:

    {langx fr-CA}Contenu{/langx}

The {langx fr-CA}{/langx} filter will convert this into the following HTML

```html
    <span lang="fr-CA">Contenu</span>
```

## Define your own custom global tags

You can define your own global tags, sometimes also called global blocks. This can only be configured by Moodle Administrators by going to **Site Administration** > **Plugins** > **Filters** > **FilterCodes**.

You can create up to 100 custom global tags by specifying the tag name. The tag name will automatically be prefixed by global_. For example, if you define a tag called *copyright*, it will create a FilterCodes tag {global_*copyright*}.

The content which you can insert is only limited by your imagination. You can include plain text content, such as one or more words, HTML source code or even a JavaScript snippet (wrap in a script tag). You can also enter almost any content using the WYSIWYG Atto or TinyMCE editor by checking the "Pretty HTML format" checkbox. This allows you to create formatted content, uploaded images and more. Note: It does not support PHP code.

Let's say you want to include a support email address in some of your courses. You could define a global tag called "global_email" and set it to "support@example.com". Then, wherever you want that email address to appear on your site, you just need to add the tag {global_email}. That way, when you decide to change the email address to "coursehelp@example.com", you need just change it here in the global custom tag settings.

## FilterCodes in a custom menu

Here are a few examples of how to create really useful custom menus using FilterCodes. Just copy and paste the code into the **Custom menu items** field (Site administration > Appearance > Theme settings). Feel free to customize these for your own needs and to make more of these for other roles like Moodle Managers, Course creators, Teachers, Teacher assistants and even Students.

**Multi-language support**

The examples often make use of strings defined in Moodle. So, if you renamed your Dashboard to My Dashboard using the Moodle language editor, it will be reflected when the menu is displayed and change language when the user changes language in Moodle.

In cases where a string is not available as a Moodle language string, some of the examples below also demonstrate how you can make use of the excellent [Multi-Language Content (v2)](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_multilang2) plugin to add support for {mlang} tags. In the examples below, English and French are used. If you only use one language, remove the {mlang} tags along with the alternate language text.

**Doesn't work?**

If FilterCodes doesn't work with your theme's custom menu, contact the developer/maintainer of the theme and refer them to the [FAQ](#faq) section of this documentation. It will provide them with an easy way for them to enable support for Moodle filters.

Alternatively, apply the Moodle core patch mentioned in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-63219 . But remember, you will need to re-apply this after each Moodle update/upgrade. The advantage of this method is that it will add support for filters in the custom menu of most Moodle themes, not just your particular theme.

Some themes may not support horizontal menu separators. Again, contact the developer/maintainer of the theme to get them to fix this or remove the -### lines.

Note: Moodle does not currently support FontAwesome icons in the primary navigation menu (e.g. {fa fa-home}). They will be ignored by Moodle. This is not a limitation of FilterCodes.

### General menu

This will add a Home link, a listing of top-level categories, a listing of courses in which you are currently enrolled, and a Logout link, but only if you are currently logged in.

```
{fa fa-home} {getstring}home{/getstring}|/{ifloggedin}?redirect=0{/ifloggedin}
{fa fa-th} {mlang en}Course catalogue{mlang}{mlang fr}Répertoire des cours{mlang}
{categories0menu}

{getstring}logout{/getstring}|/login/logout.php?sesskey={sesskey}
{/ifloggedin}
{fa fa-question} {getstring}help{/getstring}|/mod/page/view.php?id=275
```

### Admin menu

Parts of this menu will only appear for Moodle administrators, managers, course creators and teachers depending on the user's role within the current context.

For example:

- {ifincourse} menu items will only appear in a course.
- Category Course Creators will only see the Admin menu within categories where they have that role.
- Teachers will only see the Admin menu within the course where they are a teacher.

```

-{getstring}site{/getstring}: {getstring}notifications{/getstring} ({getstring}admin{/getstring})|/admin/index.php

```

Note: Previous to Moodle 4.4, the line for Theme Settings was:

```
-{getstring}site{/getstring}: {getstring:admin}themesettings{/getstring}|/admin/settings.php?section=themesettings|Including custom menus, designer mode, theme in URL
```

Tips: If you are not using the Boost theme, customize the link in the 3rd to last line to your theme's settings page.

Even better, try out {menuadmin}. It includes all of the above and more. Best of all, it only includes menu items for features that are enabled within the context of the current page.

### Developer Tools menu

If you are a developer, this little menu is worth installing FilterCodes alone.

Together with the Administration menu above, these can be a real productivity boost for developers who are tired of always digging through the **Site administration** block to find the options they are looking for. Tailor it to your particular projects with links to any page you use regularly.

This will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged in as an administrator and developer debugging mode is enabled. If you want it to display regardless of the state of developer debugging,change {ifdev} and {/ifdev} to {ifadmin} and {/ifadmin} respectively.

    {ifdev}

Notes:

- **[Code checker](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_codechecker)**, **[Moodle PHPdoc check](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_moodlecheck)** and **[Moodle Adminer](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_adminer)** require additional 3rd party plugins which will need to be installed for the links to work.

Even better, try out the dynamic **{menudev}** tag. It includes all of the above and more. Best of all, it only includes menu items for the developer tools that you have installed. Just replace everything below the words "Dev tools" and above the "{/ifdev}" line with **{menudev}**. The content that is generated by this tag is not user-configurable however we are open to suggestions.

### Theme Switcher menu

It's true, FilterCodes includes a built-in theme switcher which can be very especially useful for Moodle developers. It allows you to switch theme from a list of installed themes while staying on the current page. At the bottom of the list, you will also find handy links to Moodle's **Advanced Theme Settings** (formerly known as Theme Settings) as well as the settings for the current active theme.

Add the following tag to your custom menu:

{menuthemes}

Note that this is a top level menu that will only be visible to Site Administrators, not regular users. Also, in order for this to work, you must enable theme switching in ** Site Administration > Appearance > Advanced Theme Settings** (formerly known as Theme Settings).

## Enabling FilterCodes in the Custom Menu / Primary Navigation

Note: The source code in this section was last updated in May 2024 for Moodle 4.0 and last tested for compatibility up to Moodle 4.4.

FilterCodes can work in custom menus but, unfortunately, only if the theme supports it or you patched Moodle. If it does not work for you, contact the theme's developer and request that they add support for Moodle filters. See the instructions included below.

**Note:** In version 1.0.0 of FilterCodes, an experimental FilterCodes setting was created for the Clean and Boost themes but was only compatible and visible in Moodle 3.2 to 3.4. Unfortunately, things changed in Moodle 3.5 and it has since no longer been possible for FilterCodes to do this on its own without patching the Moodle core or the Moodle theme.

There are currently four ways to enable FilterCodes in the Custom menu/Primary Navigation. You can use any one of the following:

* Upgrade to Moodle LMS 5.0. As a site administrator, you need to navigate to Site Administration > Appearance > Advanced theme settings. Enable `Filter custom menu`.
* Use the Trema theme for Moodle LMS. If you are not using Moodle 5.0 yet, you need to navigate to Site Administration > Appearance > Trema. In the General tab, Filter navigation. This provides the same functionality as in Moodle 5.0 but is compatible with Moodle 4.0 and later.
* Patch Moodle core. See [Technique A: Patching Moodle core](#technique-a-patching-moodle-core) below.
* Patch your theme. See [Technique B: Patching your Moodle theme](#technique-b-patching-your-moodle-theme) below.

If you are still using a version of Moodle older than 4.1, we highly recommend that you upgrade your site to a supported release.

### Technique A: Patching Moodle core

Moodle 5.0 does not require any patching of Moodle core. For Moodle 3.7 to 4.5, preferred method is to patch your instance of Moodle using Git. If you did not install Moodle using Git, you can still apply the changes but you will need to do so manually.

To patch Moodle to handle this properly for most Moodle themes, cherry-pick the following patch to your Moodle site:

* Moodle 3.7: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M37
* Moodle 3.8: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M38
* Moodle 3.9: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M39
* Moodle 3.10: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M310
* Moodle 3.11: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M311
* Moodle 4.0: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M400
* Moodle 4.1: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M401
* Moodle 4.2: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M402
* Moodle 4.3: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M403
* Moodle 4.4: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-M404
* Moodle master: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219v3-master

Example: To apply the patch for Moodle using git (change the "M403" for other versions):

```bash
    git fetch https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle MDL-63219v3-M403
    git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
```

This is usually enough to make the filters work in the custom menu. However, we have noticed it may not work with some Moodle themes, most notably premium themes. Those themes will need to be patched using the Technique B.

### Technique B: Patching your Moodle theme

If technique A does not work for you, you will need to integrate a few lines of code into your Moodle theme, or ask your theme's developer/maintainer to apply this change for you. Be sure to follow the correct instructions for your version of Moodle.

#### For themes based on **boost** (Moodle 5.0)

If you are using Moodle 5.0, you should not need patch your theme. However, some 3rd party themes bypass Moodle's API when generate their navigation menu and may not yet be compatible. Please reach out to the developer and let them know that they need to make their theme compatible with Moodle 5.0.

#### For themes based on **boost** (Moodle 4.0 to 4.5)

There is no tested patch available for all 3rd party Moodle 4.0 themes. It is recommended to use Moodle core patch above which is known to work.

The follow ALPHA code is based on information available in the Boost theme for Moodle 4.x. You will **also need** to apply the theme patch **For themes based on boost (Moodle 3.2 and later)** included below.

Add this code to the core_renderer section (probably located in /theme/yourtheme/classes/navigation/output/primary.php) of your theme. Note: Your theme may even already have such a class (they often do):

```php
    use filter_manager;

    class primary extends core\navigation\output\primary {
        /**
        * Custom menu items reside on the same level as the original nodes.
        * Fetch and convert the nodes to a standardised array.
        *
        * @param renderer_base $output
        * @return array
        */
        protected function get_custom_menu(renderer_base $output): array {
            global $CFG;

            // Early return if a custom menu does not exists.
            if (empty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                return [];
            }

            $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;

            // Filter custom menu items but don't apply auto-linking filters.
            $skipfilters = array('activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters', 'urltolink');
            $filteroptions = array('originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true);
            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $context = \context_system::instance();
            $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);

            $currentlang = current_language();
            $custommenunodes = custom_menu::convert_text_to_menu_nodes($custommenuitems, $currentlang);
            $nodes = [];
            foreach ($custommenunodes as $node) {
                $nodes[] = $node->export_for_template($output);
            }

            return $nodes;
        }
    }
```

#### For themes based on **boost** (Moodle 3.2 to 3.11 and some 4.0+ to 4.6 themes)

Note: Supported in Moodle 3.2 to 3.11. Most Moodle 4.0 themes do not require this patch but some that were ported for 4.0+ still do.

Add the following code to core_renderer section (often found in /theme/yourtheme/classes/output/core_renderer.php) of your theme. Note: Your theme may even already have such a class (they often do):

```php
    use filter_manager;

    class core_renderer extends \theme_boost\output\core_renderer {
        /**
        * Applies Moodle filters to the custom menu and returns the custom menu if one has been set.
        *
        * @param string $custommenuitems - custom menuitems set by theme instead of global theme settings.
        * @return string Rendered custom_menu after filters have been applied.
        */
        public function custom_menu($custommenuitems = '') {
            global $CFG;

            if (empty($custommenuitems) && !empty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;
            }

            // Filter custom menu items without applying auto-linking filters.
            $context = \context_system::instance();
            $skipfilters = ['activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters', 'urltolink'];
            $filteroptions = ['originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true];
            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);

            $custommenu = new custom_menu($custommenuitems, current_language());
            return $this->render_custom_menu($custommenu);
        }

        /**
        * We want to show the custom menus as a list of links in the footer on small screens.
        * Just return the menu object exported so we can render it differently.
        */
        public function custom_menu_flat() {
            global $CFG;
            $custommenuitems = '';

            if (empty($custommenuitems) && !empty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;
            }

            // Filter custom menu items without applying auto-linking filters.
            $context = \context_system::instance();
            $skipfilters = ['activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters', 'urltolink'];
            $filteroptions = ['originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true];
            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);

            $custommenu = new custom_menu($custommenuitems, current_language());
            $langs = get_string_manager()->get_list_of_translations();
            $haslangmenu = $this->lang_menu() != '';

            if ($haslangmenu) {
                $strlang = get_string('language');
                $currentlang = current_language();
                if (isset($langs[$currentlang])) {
                    $currentlang = $langs[$currentlang];
                } else {
                    $currentlang = $strlang;
                }
                $this->language = $custommenu->add($currentlang, new moodle_url('#'), $strlang, 10000);
                foreach ($langs as $langtype => $langname) {
                    $this->language->add($langname, new moodle_url($this->page->url, ['lang' => $langtype]), $langname);
                }
            }

            return $custommenu->export_for_template($this);
        }
    }
```

#### For themes based on the older **bootstrapbase** (Moodle 2.7 to 3.6)

Note: Supported in Moodle 2.7 to 3.6.

Add the following code to core_renderer section (often found in /theme/yourtheme/classes/output/core_renderer.php) of your theme. Note: Your theme may even already have such a class (they often do). The important lines are chunk of code that starts with "// Filter custom menu items..." including the 5 lines that follow it:

```php
    class theme_themename_core_renderer extends theme_bootstrapbase_core_renderer {
        /**
         * Applies Moodle filters to the custom menu and custom user menu.
         *
         * Copyright: 2017-2025 TNG Consulting Inc.
         * License:   GNU GPL v3+.
         *
         * @param string $custommenuitems Current custom menu object.
         * @return Rendered custom_menu that has been filtered.
         */
        public function custom_menu($custommenuitems = '') {
            global $CFG, $PAGE;

            // Don't apply auto-linking filters.
            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $filteroptions = ['originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true];
            $skipfilters = ['activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters', 'urltolink'];

            // Filter custom user menu.
            // Don't filter custom user menu on the theme settings page. Otherwise it ends up
            // filtering the edit field itself resulting in a loss of tags.
            if ($PAGE->pagetype != 'admin-setting-themesettings') {
                $CFG->customusermenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($CFG->customusermenuitems, $PAGE->context,
                        $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }

            // Filter custom menu.
            if (empty($custommenuitems) && !emty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;
            }
            $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $PAGE->context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            $custommenu = new custom_menu($custommenuitems, current_language());
            return $this->render_custom_menu($custommenu);
        }
    }
```

## Enabling FilterCodes in HEAD

Like the Custom menu/Primary Naviation, most themes do not support applying FilterCodes to the Within HEAD field found in Site Administration > Appearance > Additional HTML. This is unfortunate because it can very useful to conditionally include Styles or JavaScript depending on who the user is, their role, a field in their user profile, or a custom field in a course.

To enable this functionality requires a developer to integrate the following code to the core_renderer class' standard_head_html() method of your theme:

```php
public function standard_head_html() {
    :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
    // Backup the current value of CFG->additionalhtmlhead.
    $additionalhtmlhead = trim($CFG->additionalhtmlhead ?? '');

    if (!empty($additionalhtmlhead)) {
        // Apply Moodle filters to additional head content.
        $context = context_system::instance();
        $options = ['context' => $context, 'noclean' => true, 'trusted' => true, 'para' => false];
        $CFG->additionalhtmlhead = format_text($additionalhtmlhead, FORMAT_HTML, $options);
    }

    // Output using the regular standard_head_html().
    $output = parent::standard_head_html();

    // Restore the original value of $CFG->additionalhtmlhead.
    $CFG->additionalhtmlhead = $additionalhtmlhead;
    :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
}
```

A slightly different version could be applied to Moodle core code if you prefer.

## Scrape'ing content

Note: This feature must be enabled in FilterCodes settings.

IMPORTANT: You cannot use this feature to scrape content from any website that requires you to be logged in to access the content. This includes your Moodle site. The {scrape} tag can only access content as a non-authenticated user, even if you are logged in.

As of version 0.4.7, you can use FileterCodes to scrape content from another web page. Your mileage may vary and depends a lot on your configuration, the website from which you are scraping content and more.

{scrape url="..." tag="..." class="..." id="..." code="..."}

Example:

{scrape url="https://example.com" tag="h1"}

When adding this tag in one of Moodle's WYSIWYG editors like Atto or TinyMCE, the tag may end up embedded in a set of HTML paragraph tags. If this happens, the content you are scraping may not result in valid HTML. To fix the problem, you will need to go into the source code view of the editor and replace the opening and closing P (paragraph) tags with div tags and then save. Alternatively, if there is nothing else in the editor, you can remove everything before and after the tag and save.

Another potential issue that could result in the message "Content is missing. Please notify the webmaster." appearing is if the editor converts the URL parameter's value into a link. If this happens, simply use the editor's **Unlink** tool to remove the hyperlink from inside the tag's URL parameter.

Parameters:

* url = The URL of the webpage from which you want to grab its content.
* tag = The HTML tag you want to capture.
* class = Optional. Default is blank (class is irrelevant). Class attribute of the HTML tag you want to capture. Must be an exact match for everything between the quotation marks.
* id = Optional. Default is blank (id is irrelevant). id tag of the HTML tag you want to capture.
* code = Optional. Default is blank (no code). This is URL encoded code that you want to insert after the content. Will be decoded before being inserted into the page. It can even be things like JavaScript for example. Be careful with this one. If not encoded, will result in an error.

If the URL fails to produce any content (broken link for example), a message will be displayed on the page encouraging the visitor to contact the webmaster. This message can be customized through the Moodle Language editor.

If the matching tag, class and/or id cannot be found, will return all of the page content without being filtered.

## Back to section / Back to course button

Help students navigate your Moodle site by implementing this handy-dandy BACK button. Works at both the section and activity level.

```html
    <p style="float:right;"><a href="{wwwroot}/course/view.php?id={courseid}&amp;section={sectionid}" class="btn btn-outline" style="font-size:14px;">Go Back</a></p>
```

If you are in a section and want to go directly back to the main course outline but scroll down to the current section, try this:

```html
    <p style="float:right;"><a href="{wwwroot}/course/view.php?id={courseid}#section-{sectionid}" class="btn btn-outline" style="font-size:14px;">Back to course outline</a></p>
```

## Optional FilterCodes for Moodle settings

FilterCodes for Moodle includes the following settings. These are available on the plugin's **Settings** page by going to:

Site administration > Plugins > Filters > Filter Codes

### Custom navigation support

Experimental: Only available in Moodle 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. Enable support for FilterCode tags in Moodle custom navigation menu. Note: Is known to be compatible with Clean and Boost-based themes.

NOTE: Does not filter tags on the Moodle Theme Settings page. This is not a bug, just a limitation.

For information on enabling FilterCodes in custom menus of other versions of Moodle, see [Enabling FilterCodes in the Custom Menu / Primary Navigation](#enabling-filtercodes-in-the-custom-menu--primary-navigation)

### Escape tags

When this option is checked, you will be able to display FilterCode tags without them being interpreted by this filter by wrapping your tag in [ brackets ]. This can be very useful when creating FilterCodes documentation for the teachers and course creators on your Moodle site.

### Hide completed courses

Enable to filter out completed courses in {mycoursesmenu} tag listings. When checked, only incomplete courses and courses where completion tracking is not enabled will be displayed. Default (unchecked) is to display all courses regardless of completion status.

### Scrape tag support

Enable or disable the {scrape} tag.

### Show contact picture

Enable or disable the display of a contact's profile picture in {coursecontacts} tag.

### Show contact's profile description

If enabled, will display the contact's profile description in {coursecontacts} tags.

### Show hidden profile fields

If enabled, custom profile fields that are hidden from the user will be displayed by the {profile_field_...} tag.

### Contact link type

Choose the type of link for the teacher\s link in the {coursecontacts} tags. Profile, Messaging, Email address or None. Choose None if you don't want just the name without a link.

### Show {categorycards} background

Enable or disable the background pattern/image for {categorycards}. You can also optionally configure the look of {categorycards} using CSS on the .fc-categorycards class.

### Global custom tags

Define your own custom global tags, sometimes also called global blocks. This feature enables you to create FilterCodes tags that are prefixed by **global_** . You can currently have up to 100 custom {global_...} tags.

### Customizing or translating the forms generated by the {form...} tags

You can translate or customize the form tags in Moodle's language editor. Here is how to do it:

1. Navigate to Site Administration > Language > Language Customization.
2. Select the language you want to customize.
3. Click the **Open Language Pack for Editing** button.
4. Wait until the **Continue** button appears. This may take a little time. Please be patient.
5. In the **Show Strings of These Components** field, scroll down and select **filter_filtercodes.php**.
6. Click the **Show Strings** button.
7. Scroll down to the strings called formcheckin, formcontactus, formcourserequest, formquickquestion and formsupport. This is the HTML for the tags of the same name.
8. Edit the form as needed.
9. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Save changes to the language pack** button.

For more information on editing language strings in Moodle, visit https://docs.moodle.org/en/Language_customisation.

Alternatively, you could simply insert the HTML for the form in the Atto editor. These {form...} tags are just provided to quickly create generic forms on your Moodle site.

# Updating

There are no special considerations required for updating the plugin.

The first public ALPHA version was released on 2017-07-07, BETA on 2017-11-11 and STABLE as of 2018-11-26.

For more information on releases since then, see
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Uninstallation

Uninstalling the plugin by going into the following:

Home > Administration > Site Administration > Plugins > Manage plugins > FilterCodes

...and click Uninstall. You may also need to manually delete the following folder if your webserver does not have the required permissions:

    /filter/filtercodes

Note that, once uninstalled, any tags and content normally handled by this plugin will become visible to all users.

# Limitations

* Be aware that enabling the Moodle "Download course content" feature may not process some tags correctly or at all through Moodle filters. As a result, tags may be displayed instead of content. This is a known Moodle issue [MDL-72894](https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-72894) which was resolved in 3.10.8+ and 3.11.4+.
* Do not use [For use in courses](#for-use-in-courses) type tags inside your course summary. Course listings and course descriptions pages are not displayed within the context of a course. These only work properly within courses. Keep context in mind.
* The {langx xx}{/langx} tag only supports inline text, not blocks of text.
* Unpredictable results may occur if you interweave HTML code with {FilterCodesTag} tags.

Incorrect example:

```html
    <strong>{FilterCodesTag}Content</strong>{/FilterCodesTag}
```

Correct example:

```html
    {FilterCodesTag}<strong>Content</strong>{/FilterCodeTag}
```

# Language Support

This plugin includes support for the English language.

If you need a different language that is not yet supported, please feel free to contribute using the Moodle AMOS Translation Toolkit for Moodle at

https://lang.moodle.org/

If the content replacing the tag contains language filtering tags, be sure to have FilterCodes above the language filter in the Moodle filter settings.

This plugin has not been tested for right-to-left (RTL) language support. If you want to use this plugin with an RTL language and it doesn't work as-is, feel free to prepare a pull request and submit it to the project page at:

https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes

# Troubleshooting

Why are tags displayed as entered instead of being converted to expected content/data?

Here are a few things you can check:

* Make sure the plugin is enabled (**On**) for both **Headings and Content** in Site Administration > Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters. See installation instructions.
* Make sure that the tag you are trying to use is supported in the version of FilterCodes you currently have installed on your Moodle site. See the CHANGELOG.md for the history of when tags were added.
* Try testing using the {firstname} tag. It was one of the very first (it's not even listed in CHANGELOG.md!). If it works with this tag, it should work with others.
* Make sure you specified any required parameters in your tag. In the case of the {langx} tag, for example, make sure you included the 2 letter language code in the opening tag. Example: {langx fr}.
* If the tags required a closing tag, make sure that it includes a forward slash and does not include any parameters. Example: {/ifenrolled}.
* If the tag requires a closing tag, Make sure that the closing tag does not contain any parameters. Only opening tags may contain parameters.
* If it doesn't work with a particular 3rd party theme (i.e. not included with Moodle), try it using it in the Boost theme.
* If it doesn't work with a particular 3rd party plugin (i.e. not included with Moodle), try using the tag in an HTML block or label.
* If you have determined that the problem is with a 3rd party plugin or theme, please report the issue to its developer using the **Bug Tracker** link on the plugin's page located at moodle.org/plugins. Provide as much information as you can. It may be helpful to point them to the [Moodle Output API documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Output_functions), specifically the format_text() and format_string() functions.
* If it still doesn't work, chances are that this part of Moodle doesn't support filters yet. It is rare but it happens (example: Badges). Please report the part of Moodle that doesn't support filters in the [Moodle Tracker](https://tracker.moodle.org). Nothing can be done to make FilterCodes work here until this has been fixed.
* Read the FAQ section.
* If all else fails, ask questions. There are links on the [FilterCodes](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_filtercodes) plugin page to the [Discussion](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=359252) forum for getting help and the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues) on GitHub for reporting bugs.

Note: There have also been reported cases where some tags in URLs, like {wwwroot}, do not seem to work. We have found that this can sometimes happen:

* If **nginx** is being used but not configured correctly.
* If you are using Moodle's **Log In As** feature, there are several reports of Moodle re-writing HTML when logged in as another user. It does not just affect FilterCodes. See https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-65372

More helpful information can be found in the [FAQ](#faq) below.

# FAQ
## Answers to Frequently Asked Questions

IMPORTANT: Although we expect everything to work, this release has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

### Can I combine/nest conditional tags?

Yes. You can only combine (AND) them. The two, or more, tags must be all be true for the content to be displayed. For example:

    {ifloggedin}{ifenrolled}You are logged in and enrolled in this course.{/ifenrolled}{/ifloggedin}

This plugin does not support {IF this OR that} type conditions at this time. Depending on your requirement, the {ifmin...} tags might help you achieve this. These tags enable you to display content to users with a minimum role level. This could be useful if you wanted to only display a message to faculty such as (teacher or above).

### How can {ifactivitycompleted} work for the completion of a combination of multiple activities?

You will need to use the Pulse plugin for Moodle LMS by Stefan Scholz. It allows you to have one activity completion reflect the completed status of multiple other activities. Dave Foord has an excellent tutorial on how to use this on his YouTube channel at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlmLjIUFC6I . Once you have that setup, you will then be able to use FilterCodes {ifactivitycompleted} tag to do whatever you want based on the completion of the one Pulse activity.

### I am using FilterCodes on a multi-language site. Some of my non-FilterCode tags are not being processed. How can I fix this?

This is a pretty common question. Simply move FilterCodes to the top of the list in Site **Administration > Plugins > Filter > Filter Management**. The only exception to this would be if one of your other filters were generating content that should be included in FilterCode tags. In that case, place that plugin above FilterCodes so that it processes those tags first.

### How can I use this to pre-populate one or more fields in a Contact Form for Moodle?

Just put the tag in the input's value parameter. Here are a couple of examples:

```html
    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" value="{email}">
    <input id="name" name="name" type="text" required="required" value="{fullname}">
```

Pro Tip: You can pre-populate a field and make it non-editable for logged in users using a conditional tag:

```html
    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" {ifloggedin}readonly{/ifloggedin} value="{email}">
    <input id="name" name="name" type="text" required="required" {ifloggedin}readonly{/ifloggedin} value="{fullname}">
```

### Why do administrators see the text of all other roles when using {ifminxxxx}Content{/ifminxxxx} tags?

This is normal as the administrator has the permission of all other roles. The {ifmin...} tags will display content if the user has a minimum of the specified role or above. For example, {ifminteacher}Content here!{/ifminteacher} will display "Content here!" whether the user is a teacher, course creator, manager or administrator even if they are not a teacher.

### Is there a tag to display...?

Only the tags listed in this [documentation](#usage) are currently supported, though the version on GitHub is often newer than on Moodle.org. We are happy to add new functionality in future releases of FilterCodes. Please post all requests in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues). You will also find a link for this on the plugin's page. The subject line should start with "Feature Request: ".

When requesting a new tag, please provide:

* As much detail as possible on what you are trying to accomplish.
* An example of how it would be used.
* If possible, where in Moodle the information would come from.

Be sure to check back on your issue as we may have further questions for you.

If you have the skills, feel free to contribute code for new tags. These are more likely to get integrated quicker (subject to our review and approval).

### Why does the {button} tag not work?

It works just fine. Here are 3 examples:

    {button https://www.tngconsulting.ca}TNG Consulting Inc.{/button}

This one just creates a button called **TNG Consulting Inc.** that will take you to the website when clicked.

    {button https://google.ca" target="_blank}Google{/button}

This one will create a button called "Google" which will open a new tab in your browser and then take you to the website.

    {button {wwwroot}/my}{getstring}myhome{/getstring}{/button}

The last one will create a button called "Dashboard", using the Moodle language strings ({getstrings} is a FilterCode too). When clicked, it will take the user to your Moodle site's dashboard, regardless of where Moodle is installed (webroot or subdirectory).

The trick is to make sure that Moodle doesn't convert the URL to a link in the editor. If it does (probably blue, underlined), you will need to use the Unlink tool to turn it back into plain text. Once saved, it will appear as a button. Alternatively, disable the **Convert URLs into links and images** filter in Site Administration > Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters and then re-enter the {button} FilterCode.

### How can I style the {coursecontacts} tag?

Here is an example that reduces the image and places the information next to it. Just add this CSS to your site:

```css
    .fc-coursecontacts li {
        clear:both;
        font-size: 1.3rem;
        line-height: initial;
    }
    .fc-coursecontacts img {
        width: 40%;
        float: left;
    }
    .fc-coursecontactroles {
        display: block;
    }
    .fc-coursecontacts div {
        border-top: 1px solid lightgrey;
        margin-top: 5px;
        padding-top: 5px
    }
```

### Do you have examples/samples of how tags work in my version of FilterCodes?

Create a Page on your Moodle site, preferably in a course, so that those tags work too, and include the following code:

You can switch to different roles to see how each will affect the content being displayed.

### When a user is logged out, the First name, Surname, Full Name, Email address and Username are empty. How can I set default values for these tags?

You can do this using the language editor built into Moodle. There is currently support for the following defaults: defaultfirstname, defaultsurname, defaultusername, defaultemail. By default, these are blank. As for the Full Name, it is made up of the first name and surname separated by a space and is therefore not settable.

### I added the "{mycoursesmenu}" to my custom menu. How can I hide it if the user is not logged in?

You can use the {ifloggedin}{/ifloggedin} tags to conditionally hide it when users are not logged in. Example:

{ifloggedin}My Courses
{mycoursesmenu}{/ifloggedin}

### How can I add a "Logout" link in my custom menu?

Just add the following line to your custom menu (under Appearance > Theme settings)

{ifloggedin}Logout|/login/logout.php?sesskey={sesskey}{/ifloggedin}

Bonus: This is also how you would hide it for users who are not logged in.

### How can I create a menu that is just for administrators or some other roles?

Building on the previous two questions, see the [usage](#usage) section for some examples. Share your ideas in the discussion forum.

### Why is the IP Address listed as 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1?

0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 is the same as localhost and it means that your web browser is probably on the same computer as your web server. This shouldn't happen with users accessing your Moodle site from their desktop or mobile device.

### Why does it show me as enrolled on the frontpage?

The Frontpage is a course in Moodle. All users are enrolled by default in this course.

### I added the {recaptcha} tag in my webform. Why doesn't the reCAPTCHA show up?

First, the reCAPTCHA is only made to work with forms processed by the Contact Form for Moodle plugin. That said, it is 100% generated by Moodle API so, if you have some other purpose, it will probably work as well as long as the receiving form is made to process it.

For reCAPTCHA to work, you need to configure the site and secret keys in Moodle. For more information, log into your Moodle site as a Site Administrator and navigate to **Site Administration > Authentication > Manage Authentication** and configure the ReCAPTCHA site key and ReCAPTCHA secret key. You will also need to enable ReCAPTCHA in the settings of the Contact Form plugin.

If you are using older versions of Moodle before 3.1.11+, 3.2.8+, 3.3.5+, 3.4.5+ and 3.5+, that implementation of ReCAPTCHA is no longer supported by Google.

### How can I get the {scrape} tag to work?

You need to enable this feature in the FilterCodes settings in Moodle.

### How can I scrape content from more than one web page or more than one website?

Use multiple {scrape} tags.

### How can I scrape content based on a pattern of HTML tags instead of just one HTML tag with a class or id? Example, an h1 tag inside the div class="content" tag.

That is not possible at this time. This is a very simple scraper. With some funding or contributions, this feature can be enhanced.

### How can I get the {getstring} tag to work? It doesn't seem to be replaced with the correct text.

Verify that the component (plugin) name and/or the string key are correct. If a component name is not specified, it will default to "moodle". If you recently modified a language file manually in Moodle, you may need to refresh the Moodle cache.

### How can I customize or translate the forms generated by the {form...} tags?

See **Customizing or translating the forms generated by the {form...} tags** in the [Usage](#usage) section.

### Is there more information about the {ifprofile shortname ...} tag?

{ifprofile shortname ...} is a conditional tag that enables you to display information depending on the value of fields in a user's profile.

Here is a list of the various options you can use with it:

{ifprofile shortname is "value"}...{/ifprofile}
{ifprofile shortname not "value"}...{/ifprofile}
{ifprofile shortname is ""}...{/ifprofile}
{ifprofile shortname not ""}...{/ifprofile}
{ifprofile shortname contains "value"}...{/ifprofile}
{ifprofile shortname in "value"}...{/ifprofile}

**Notes:**

The only comparison operators currently supported are 'is', 'not', 'contains' and 'in'.

The "value" must always be enclosed in quotes. Use an empty set of quotes to compare the value to an empty field.

The shortname can be any visible custom profile fields, unless the FilterCodes ifprofilefiedonlyvisible setting is unchecked, as well as the core profile fields including:

* id
* username
* auth
* idnumber
* email
* institution
* department
* city
* country
* timezone
* lang

Important: The specified value must be the value that is stored in the database, which may be different than what is displayed when you view a user profile. Here are some examples:

* You must specify CA for the country of Canada, not Canada, when comparing to the country field.
* If your profile field contains a multi-language string, you need to specify the string as it is before it is processed by Moodle language filters.
* For dropdown fields, you may need to view the HTML code to see what the actual values are for a field.
* For checkboxes, the checked value is 1, unchecked is 0.

Reminder: When logged out (or in as guest), user profile fields do not exist. Therefore, "not" will always evaluate to true and "is", "contains" and "in" will evaluate to false.

### What are the supported dateTimeFormat formats?

The date and time formats, defined in Moodle (langconfig.php)[https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/lang/en/langconfig.php], control how dates and times will be displayed.

The following formats are supported:

* backupnameformat
* strftimedate
* strftimedatemonthabbr
* strftimedatefullshort
* strftimedateshort
* strftimedateshortmonthabbr
* strftimedatetime
* strftimedaydate
* strftimedaydatetime  (this is the default format when not specified)
* strftimedayshort
* strftimedaytime
* strftimemonthyear
* strftimerecent
* strftimerecentfull
* strftimetime
* strftimetime12
* strftimetime24

As of version 2.2.8+ of FilterCodes, you can also use (strftime)[https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php] formats.

Note: The date and/or time format can vary depending on the language pack in use. While you can customize these using the Moodle language customization tool included with Moodle, making such a change will could affect the format of dates displayed throughout your Moodle site. Pro tip: Standardize the date format used throughout your site as much as possible to minimize the chance of potentially confusing your learners.
