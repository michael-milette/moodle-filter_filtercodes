# Basic Overview

FilterCodes filter for Moodle enables content creators to easily customize and personalize Moodle sites and course content using over 135 plain text tags that can be used **almost** anywhere in Moodle.

In addition, it also enables you to:

* Add user interface (UI) elements
* Inserting non-breaking spaces;
* Tagging text as being in a different language;

Usage of the FilterCodes tags requires no knowledge of HTML but might be important for sites wishing to comply with accessibility requirements.

**IMPORTANT**: This STABLE release has been tested on many Moodle sites. Although we expect everything to work, if you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

**ALPHA TAGS**: There may be some tags identified as ALPHA in this documentation. These may still require some development and are not guarantied to be implemented at all or implemented in the same way in future releases. Please let us know if you think they are useful if they work for you or what changes you might like to see.

### HTML and "lang" tagging

* {-} : Is substituted for &shy;, a soft hyphen that only appears when needed.
* {nbsp} : Is substituted for a non-breaking space when displayed.
* {hr} : Horizontal rule.
* {details}{summary}{/summary}{/details} : An easy way to create an HTML 5 Details/Summary expandable section in your page. IMPORTANT: {details}{summary}{/summary} must all be on one line (it is ok if the line wraps). The rest of the details can be on multiple lines followed by the {/details}. This is an experimental feature which may result in invalid HTML but it works.
* {langx xx}{/langx} : Tag specific text in a particular language by wrapping the text in a plain text pair of {langx xx} {/langx} or {langx xx-XX} {/langx} tags. This makes no visible changes to the content but wraps the content in an HTML <span lang="xx"></span> inline tag. As a result, screen readers will make use of this localization information to apply a particular pronunciation if the text is in a different language than the language of the rest of the page. This is required for compliance with W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0)

The opening {langx xx} tag should include two [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) language code abbreviation letters in lowercase associated with language's name. French, for example, has the code **fr**:

    {langx fr}Contenu{/langx}

The {langx fr}{/langx} filter will convert this into the following HTML

    <span lang="fr">Contenu</span>

The opening {langx xx} may also include a [culture code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_localisation) used in countries and regions. This includes an additional dash and two uppercase letters associated with language's region or country. French Canadian, for example, has the code **fr-CA**:

    {langx fr-CA}Contenu{/langx}

The {langx fr-CA}{/langx} filter will convert this into the following HTML

    <span lang="fr-CA">Contenu</span>

## Define your own custom global tags

You can define your own global tags, sometimes also called global blocks. This can only be configured by Moodle Administrators by going to **Site Administration** > **Plugins** > **Filters** > **FilterCodes**.

You can create up to 20 custom global tags by specifying the tag name. The tag name will automatically be prefixed by global. For example, if you define a tag called *copyright*, it will create a FilterCodes tag {global_*copyright*}.

The content which you can insert is only limited by your imagination. You can include plain text content, such as one or more words, HTML source code or even a JavaScript snippet (wrap in a script tag). You can also enter almost any content using the WYSIWYG Atto editor by checking the "Pretty HTML format" checkbox. This allows you to create formatted content, uploaded images and more. Note: It does not support PHP code.

Let's say you want to include a support email address in some of your courses. You could define a global tag called "global_email" and set it to "support@example.com". Then, wherever you want that email address to appear on your site, you just need to add the tag {global_email}. That way, when you decide to change the email address to "coursehelp@example.com", you need just change it here in the clobal custom tag settings.

## FilterCodes in a custom menu

Here are a few examples of how to create really useful custom menus using FilterCodes. Just copy and paste the code into the **Custom menu items** field (Site administration > Appearance > Theme settings). Feel free to customize these for your own needs and to make more of these for other roles like Moodle Managers, Course creators, Teachers, Teacher assistants and even Students.

**Multi-language support**

The examples often make use of strings defined in Moodle. So, if you renamed your Dashboard to My Dashboard using the Moodle language editor, it will be reflected when the menu is displayed and change language when the user changes language in Moodle.

In cases where a string is not available as a Moodle language strings, some of the examples below also demonstrate how you can make use of the excellent [Multi-Language Content (v2)](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_multilang2) plugin to add support for {mlang} tags. In the examples below, English and French are used. If you only use one langauge, remove the {mlang} tags along with the alternate language text.

**Doesn't work?**

If FilterCodes doesn't work with your theme's custom menu, contact the developer / maintainer of the theme and refer them to the [FAQ](#faq) section of this documentation. It will provide them with an easy way for them to enable support for Moodle filters.

Alternatively, apply the Moodle core patch mentioned in https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-63219 . But remember, you will need to re-apply this after each Moodle update/upgrade. The advantage of this method is that it will add support for filters in the custom menu of most Moodle themes, not just your particular theme.

Some themes may not support horizontal menu separators. Again, contact the developer / maintainer of the theme to get them to fix this or remove the -### lines.

### General menu

This will add a Home link, a listing of top-level categories, a listing of courses in which you are currently enrolled, and a Logout link, but only if you are currently logged in.

    {fa fa-home} {getstring}home{/getstring}|/{ifloggedin}?redirect=0{/ifloggedin}
    {fa fa-th} {mlang en}Course catalogue{mlang}{mlang fr}Répertoire des cours{mlang}

    {/ifloggedin}
    {fa fa-question} {getstring}help{/getstring}|/mod/page/view.php?id=275

### Admin menu

Parts of this menu will only appear for Moodle administrators, managers, course creators and teachers depending on the user's role within the current context. For example:

- {ifincourse} menu items will only appear in a course.
- Category Course Creators will only see the Admin menu within categories where they have that role.
- Teachers will only see the Admin menu within the course where they are a teacher.

Tips: If you are not using the Boost theme, customize the link in the 3rd to last line to your theme's settings page.

### Developer Tools menu

If you are a developer, this little menu is worth installing FilterCodes alone.

Together with the Administration menu above, these can be a real productivity boost for developers who are tired of always digging through the **Site administration** block to find the options they are looking for. Tailor it to your particular projects with links to any page you use regularly.

This will display the enclosed content only if the user is logged-in as an administrator and developer debugging mode is enabled. If you want it to display regardless of the state of developer debugging,change {ifdev} and {/ifdev} to {ifadmin} and {/ifadmin} respectively.

Notes:

- **[Code checker](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_codechecker)**, **[Moodle PHPdoc check](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_moodlecheck)** and **[Moodle Adminer](https://moodle.org/plugins/local_adminer)** require add-on 3rd party plugins which need to be installed in order for the links to work.

Even better, try out {menudev}. It includes all of the above and more. Best of all, it only includes menu items for the developer tools that you have installed. Just replace everything below the words "Dev tools" and above the "{/ifdev}" line.

## FilterCodes in custom menus

Note: The source code in this section was updated in May 2021.

FilterCodes can work in custom menus but but, unfortunately, only if the theme supports it or you patched Moodle. If it does not work for you, contact the theme's developer and request that they add support for Moodle filters. See instructions are included below.

**Note:** As of version 1.0.0 of FilterCodes, experimental support was added for Clean and Boost themes in Moodle 3.2 to 3.4. In order to work, this had to be enabled in FilterCodes settings and Filtering will not be applied to the Moodle Theme Settings page. Unfortunately things changed in Moodle 3.5 and it has since not been possible for FilterCodes to do this on its own.

There are two ways to make FilterCodes work in Moodle's custom menu:

1. Add a few lines of code to your Moodle theme. Even better, your theme's developer to enable this in their themes.

### For themes based on **boost** (Moodle 3.2 and later)

Note: Supported in Moodle 3.2 and later.

Add the following code to core_renderer section of your theme. Note: Your theme may even already have such a class (they often do):

    use filter_manager;

    class core_renderer extends \theme_boost\output\core_renderer {
        /**
         * Applies Moodle filters to custom menu and custom user menu.
         *
         * @param string $custommenuitems Current custom menu object.
         * @return Rendered custom_menu that has been filtered.
         */
        public function custom_menu($custommenuitems = '') {
            global $CFG, $PAGE;

            // Don't apply auto-linking filters.
            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $filteroptions = ['originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true];
            $skipfilters = ['activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters', 'urltolink'];

            // Filter custom user menu.
            // Don't filter custom user menu on the settings page. Otherwise it ends up
            // filtering the edit field itself resulting in a loss of the tag.
            if ($PAGE->pagetype != 'admin-setting-themesettings' && stripos($CFG->customusermenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $CFG->customusermenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($CFG->customusermenuitems, $PAGE->context,
                        $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }

            // Filter custom menu.
            if (empty($custommenuitems) && !empty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;
            }
            if (stripos($custommenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $PAGE->context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }
            $custommenu = new custom_menu($custommenuitems, current_language());
            return $this->render_custom_menu($custommenu);
        }

        /**
         * We want to show the custom menus as a list of links in the footer on small screens.
         * Just return the menu object exported so we can render it differently.
         */
        public function custom_menu_flat() {
            global $CFG, $PAGE;
            $custommenuitems = '';

            // Don't apply auto-linking filters.
            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $filteroptions = ['originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true];
            $skipfilters = ['activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters', 'urltolink'];

            if (empty($custommenuitems) && !empty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;
            }
            if (stripos($custommenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $PAGE->context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }
            $custommenu = new custom_menu($custommenuitems, current_language());
            $langs = get_string_manager()->get_list_of_translations();
            $haslangmenu = $this->lang_menu() != '';

            if ($haslangmenu) {
                $strlang = get_string('language');
                $currentlang = current_language();
                if (isset($langs[$currentlang])) {
                    $currentlang = $langs[$currentlang];
                } else {
                    $currentlang = $strlang;
                }
                $this->language = $custommenu->add($currentlang, new moodle_url('#'), $strlang, 10000);
                foreach ($langs as $langtype => $langname) {
                    $this->language->add($langname, new moodle_url($this->page->url, ['lang' => $langtype]), $langname);
                }
            }

            return $custommenu->export_for_template($this);
        }
    }

### For themes based on the older **bootstrapbase** (Moodle 2.7 to 3.6)

Note: Supported in Moodle 2.7 to 3.6.

Add the following code to core_renderer section of your theme for Moodle 2.7 to 3.6. Be sure to replace "themename" with the name of the theme's directory. Note: Your theme may even already have such a class (they often do):

    class theme_themename_core_renderer extends theme_bootstrapbase_core_renderer {
        /**
         * Applies Moodle filters to custom menu and custom user menu.
         *
         * Copyright: 2017-2021 TNG Consulting Inc.
         * License:   GNU GPL v3+.
         *
         * @param string $custommenuitems Current custom menu object.
         * @return Rendered custom_menu that has been filtered.
         */
        public function custom_menu($custommenuitems = '') {
            global $CFG, $PAGE;

            // Don't apply auto-linking filters.
            $filtermanager = filter_manager::instance();
            $filteroptions = ['originalformat' => FORMAT_HTML, 'noclean' => true];
            $skipfilters = ['activitynames', 'data', 'glossary', 'sectionnames', 'bookchapters', 'urltolink'];

            // Filter custom user menu.
            // Don't filter custom user menu on the theme settings page. Otherwise it ends up
            // filtering the edit field itself resulting in a loss of tags.
            if ($PAGE->pagetype != 'admin-setting-themesettings' && stripos($CFG->customusermenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $CFG->customusermenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($CFG->customusermenuitems, $PAGE->context,
                        $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }

            // Filter custom menu.
            if (empty($custommenuitems) && !emty($CFG->custommenuitems)) {
                $custommenuitems = $CFG->custommenuitems;
            }
            if (stripos($custommenuitems, '{') !== false) {
                $custommenuitems = $filtermanager->filter_text($custommenuitems, $PAGE->context, $filteroptions, $skipfilters);
            }
            $custommenu = new custom_menu($custommenuitems, current_language());
            return $this->render_custom_menu($custommenu);
        }
    }

2. Patch your instance of Moodle. Even better, encourage Moodle HQ to enable this functionality in future releases of Moodle. For more information and to vote for this functionality, see
   https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues/67 .

To patch Moodle to handle this properly for most Moodle themes, apply the following patch to Moodle:

* Moodle 3.7: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M37
* Moodle 3.8: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M38
* Moodle 3.9: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M39
* Moodle 3.10: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M310
* Moodle 3.11: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-M311
* Moodle master: https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle/tree/MDL-63219-master

## Scrape'ing content

Note: This feature must be enabled in FilterCodes settings.

IMPORTANT: You cannot use this feature to scrape content from any website that requires you to be logged-in in order to access the content. The {scrape} tag can only access content as a non-authenticated user, even if you are logged-in.

As of version 0.4.7, you can now use FileterCodes to scrape content from another web page. Your mileage may vary and depends a lot on your configuration, the website from which you are scraping content and more.

{scrape url="..." tag="..." class="..." id="..." code="..."}

Tip: When adding this tag in one of Moodle's WYSIWYG editors like Atto or TinyMCE, the tag may end up embedded in a set of HTML paragraph tags. If this happens, the content you are scraping may not result in valid HTML. To fix the problem, you will need to go into the source code view of the editor and replace the P (paragraph) tags with div and then save. Alternatively, if there is nothing else in the editor, you can remove everything before and after the tag and save.

Parameters:

* url = The URL of the webpage from which you want to grab its content.
* tag = The HTML tag you want to capture.
* class = Optional. Default is blank (class is irrelevant). Class attribute of the HTML tag you want to capture. Must be an exact match for everything between the quotation marks.
* id = Optional. Default is blank (id is irrelevant). id tag of the HTML tag you want to capture.
* code = Optional. Default is blank (no code). This is URL encoded code that you want to insert after the content. Will be decoded before being inserted into the page. Can be things like JavaScript for example. Be careful with this one. If not encoded, will result in error.

If the URL fails to produce any content (broken link for example), a message will be displayed on the page encouraging the visitor to contact the webmaster. This message can be customized through the Moodle Language editor.

If a matching tag, class and/or id can't be found, will return all of the page content without being filtered.

## Back to section / Back to course

Help students navigate your Moodle site by implementing this handy-dandy BACK button. Works at both the section and activity level.

    <p style="float:right;"><a href="{wwwroot}/course/view.php?id={courseid}&amp;section={sectionid}" class="btn btn-outline" style="font-size:14px;">Go Back</a></p>

If you are in a section and want to go directly back to the main course outline but scroll down to the current section, try this:

    <p style="float:right;"><a href="{wwwroot}/course/view.php?id={courseid}#section-{sectionid}" class="btn btn-outline" style="font-size:14px;">Back to course outline</a></p>

## Optional FilterCodes for Moodle settings

FilterCodes for Moodle includes the following settings. These are available on the plugin's **Settings** page by going to:

Site administration > Plugins > Filters > Filter Codes

### Custom navigation support

Experimental: Only available in Moodle 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4. Enable support for FilterCode tags in Moodle custom navigation menu. Note: Is known to be compatible with Clean and Boost based themes.

NOTE: Does not filter tags on the Moodle Theme Settings page. This is not a bug, just a limitation.

For information on enabling FilterCodes in custom menus of other versions of Moodle, see [FilterCodes in a custom menu](#filtercodes-in-a-custom-menu)

### Escape tags

When this option is checked, you will be able to display FilterCode tags without them being interpreted by this filter by wrapping your tag in [ brackets ]. This can be very useful when creating FilterCodes documentation for the teachers and course creators on your Moodle site.

### Hide completed courses

Enable to filter out completed courses in {mycoursesmenu} tag listings. When checked, only incomplete courses and courses where completion tracking is not enabled will be displayed. Default (unchecked) is to display all courses regardless of completion status..

### Scrape tag support

Enable or disable the {scrape} tag.

### Show teacher picture

Enable or disable showing of teacher profile picture in {courseteachers} tag.

### Teacher link type

Choose the type of link for the teacher\s link in the {courseteachers} tags. Choose none if you don't want the name to be a link.

### Show {categorycards} background

Enable or disable the background pattern/image for {categorycards}. You can also optionally configure the look of {categorycards} using CSS on the .fc-categorycards class.

### Global custom tags

Define your own global tags, sometimes also called global blocks. This feature enables you to create your own tags that are prefixed by global_ . You can currently define up to 20 custom {global_...} tags.

### Customizing or translating the forms generated by the {form...} tags

You can translate or customize the form tags in Moodle's language editor. Here is how to do it:

1. Navigate to Site Administration > Language > Language Customization.
2. Select the language you want to customize.
3. Click the **Open Language Pack for Editing** button.
4. Wait until the **Continue** button apppears. This may take a little time. Please be patient.
5. In the **Show Strings of These Components** field, scroll down and select **filter_filtercodes.php**.
6. Click the **Show Strings** button.
7. Scroll down to the strings called formcheckin, formcontactus, formcourserequest, formquickquestion and formsupport. This is the HTML for the tags of the same name.
8. Edit the form as needed.
9. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click the **Save changes to the language pack** button.

For more information on editing language strings in Moodle, visit: https://docs.moodle.org/en/Language_customisation.

Alternatively, you could simply insert the HTML for the form in the Atto editor. These {form...} tags are just provided to quickly create generic forms on your Moodle site.

# Updating

There are no special considerations required for updating the plugin.

The first public ALPHA version was released on 2017-07-07, BETA on 2017-11-11 and STABLE as of 2018-11-26.

For more information on releases since then, see
[CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

# Uninstallation

Uninstalling the plugin by going into the following:

Home > Administration > Site Administration > Plugins > Manage plugins > FilterCodes

...and click Uninstall. You may also need to manually delete the following folder:

    /filter/filtercodes

Note that, once uninstalled, any tags and content normally handled by this plugin will become visible to all users.

# Limitations

* Do not use [For use in courses](#for-use-in-courses) type tags inside your course summary. Course listings and course descriptions pages are not displayed within the context of a course. These only work properly within courses. Keep context in mind.
* The {langx xx}{/langx} tag only supports inline text, not blocks of text.
* Unpredictable results may occur if you interweave HTML code with {FilterCodesTag} tags.

Incorrect example:

    <strong>{FilterCodesTag}Content</strong>{/FilterCodesTag}

Correct example:

    {FilterCodesTag}<strong>Content</strong>{/FilterCodeTag}

# Language Support

This plugin includes support for the English language.

If you need a different language that is not yet supported, please feel free to contribute using the Moodle AMOS Translation Toolkit for Moodle at

https://lang.moodle.org/

If the content replacing the tag contains language filtering tags, be sure to have FilterCodes above the language filter in the Moodle filter settings.

This plugin has not been tested for right-to-left (RTL) language support. If you want to use this plugin with a RTL language and it doesn't work as-is, feel free to prepare a pull request and submit it to the project page at:

https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes

# Troubleshooting

Why are tags displayed as entered instead of being converted to expected content/data?

Here are a few things you can check:

* Make sure the plugin is enabled (**On**) for both **Headings and Content** in Site Administration > Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters. See installation instructions.
* Make sure that the tag you are trying to use is supported in the version of FilterCodes you currently have installed on your Moodle site. See the CHANGELOG.md for the history of when tags were added.
* Try testing using the {firstname} tag. It was one of the very first (it's not even in the history). If it works with this tags, it should work with others.
* Make sure you specified any required parameters in your tag. In the case of the {langx} tag for example, make sure you included the 2 letter language code in the opening tag. Example: {langx fr}.
* If the tags required a closing tag, make sure that it includes a forward slash and does not include any parameters. Example: {/ifenrolled}.
* If the tag requires a closing tag, Make sure that the closing tag does not contain any parameters. Only opening tags may contain parameters.
* If it doesn't work with a particular 3rd party theme (i.e. not included with Moodle), try it using it in the Boost theme.
* If it doesn't work with a particular 3rd party plugin (i.e. not included with Moodle), try using the tag in an HTML block or label.
* If you have determined that the problem is with a 3rd party plugin or theme, please report the issue to its developer using the **Bug Tracker** link on the plugin's page located at moodle.org/plugins. Provide as much information as you can. It may be helpful to point them to the [Moodle Output API documentation](https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Output_functions), specifically the format_text() and format_string() functions.
* If it still doesn't work, chances are that this some part of Moodle doesn't support filters yet. It is rare but it happens (example: Badges). Please report the part of Moodle that doesn't support filters in the [Moodle Tracker](https://tracker.moodle.org).
* Read the rest of this FAQ section.
* If all else fails, ask questions. There are links on the [FilterCodes](https://moodle.org/plugins/filter_filtercodes) plugin page to the [Discussion](https://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=359252) forum for getting help and the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues) on GitHub for reporting bugs.

More helpful information can be found in the [FAQ](#faq) below.

# FAQ
## Answers to Frequently Asked Questions

IMPORANT: Although we expect everything to work, this release has not been fully tested in every situation. If you find a problem, please help by reporting it in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues).

### Can I combine/nest conditional tags?

Yes. You can only combine (AND) them. The two or more tags must be true in order for the content to be displayed. For example:

{ifloggedin}{ifenrolled}You are logged-in and enrolled in this course.{/ifenrolled}{/ifloggedin}

This plugin does not support {IF this OR that} type conditions at this time. Depending on your requirement, the {ifmin...} tags might help you achieve this. These tags enable you to display content to users with a minimum role level. This could be useful if you wanted to only display a message to faculty such as (teacher or above).

### I am using FilterCodes on a multi-language site. Some of my non-FilterCode tags are not being processed. How can I fix this?

This is actually a pretty common question. Simply move FilterCodes to the top of the list in your Moodle Filter Management. The only exception to this would be if one of your other filters were generating content that included FilterCode tags. In that case, place that plugin above FilterCodes.

### How can I use this to pre-populate one or more fields in a Contact Form for Moodle?

Just put the tag in the input's value parameter. Here are a couple of examples:

    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" value="{email}">
    <input id="name" name="name" type="text" required="required" value="{fullname}">

Pro Tip: You can pre-populate a field and make it non-editable for logged-in users using a conditional tag:

    <input id="email" name="email" type="email" required="required" {ifloggedin}readonly{/ifloggedin} value="{email}">
    <input id="name" name="name" type="text" required="required" {ifloggedin}readonly{/ifloggedin} value="{fullname}">

### Why do administrators see the text of all other roles when using {ifminxxxx}Content{/ifminxxxx} tags?

This is normal as the administrator has the permission of all other roles. The {ifmin...} tags will display content if the user has a minimum of the specified role or above. For example, {ifminteacher}Content here!{/ifminteacher} will display "Content here!" whether the user is a teacher, course creator, manager or administrator even if they are not a teacher.

### Is there a tag to display...?

Only the tags listed in this [documentation](#usage) are currently supported (version on GitHub is often newer than on Moodle.org). We are happy to add new functionality in future releases of FilterCodes. Please post all requests in the [Bug Tracker](https://github.com/michael-milette/moodle-filter_filtercodes/issues). You'll also find a link for this on the plugin's page. The subject line should start with "Feature Request: ".

When requesting a new tag, please provide:

* As much detail as possible on what you are trying to accomplish.
* An example of how it would be used.
* If possible, where in Moodle the information would come from.

Be sure to check back on your issue as we may have further questions for you.

### Why does the {button} tag not work?

It works just fine. Here are 3 examples:

{button https://www.tngconsulting.ca}TNG Consulting Inc.{/button}

This one just creates a button called **TNG Consulting Inc.** that will take you to the website when clicked.

{button https://google.ca" target="_blank}Google{/button}

This one will create a button called "Google" which will open a new tab in your browser and then take you to the website.

{button {wwwroot}/my}{getstring}myhome{/getstring}{/button}

The last one will create a button called "Dashboard", using the Moodle language strings ({getstrings} is a FilterCode too). When clicked, it will take the user to your Moodle site's dashboard, regardless of where Moodle is installed (webroot or subdirectory).

The trick is to make sure that Moodle doesn't convert the URL to a link in the editor. If it does (probably blue, underlined), you will need to use the Unlink tool to turn it back into plain text. Once saved, it will appear as a button. Alternatively, disable the **Convert URLs into links and images** filter in Site Administration > Plugins > Filters > Manage Filters and then re-enter the {button} FilterCode.

### Do you have examples, samples and ways to which tags are working in my version of FilterCodes?

Create a Page on your Moodle site, preferably in a course, so that those tags work too, and include the following code:

</details>
You can switch to different roles to see how each will affect the content being displayed.

### When a user is logged out, the First name, Surname, Full Name, Email address and Username are empty. How can I set default values for these tags?

You can do this using the language editor built into Moodle. There is currently support for the following defaults: defaultfirstname, defaultsurname, defaultusername, defaultemail. By default, these are blank. As for the Full Name, it is made up of the first name and surname separated by a space and is therefore not settable.

### I added the "{mycoursesmenu}" to my custom menu. How can I hide it if the user is not logged in?

You can use the {ifloggedin}{/ifloggedin} tags to conditionally hide it when users are not logged in. Example:

{ifloggedin}My Courses
{mycoursesmenu}{/ifloggedin}

### How can I add a "Logout" link in my custom menu?

Just add the following line to your custom menu (under Appearance > Theme settings)

{ifloggedin}Logout|/login/logout.php?sesskey={sesskey}{/ifloggedin}

Bonus: This is also how you would hide it for users who are not logged-in.

### How can I create a menu that is just for administrators or some other roles?

Building on the previous two questions, see the [usage](#usage) section for some examples. Feel free to share your own ideas in the discussion forum.

### Why is the IP Address listed as 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1?

0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 is the same as localhost and it means that your web browser is probably on the same computer as your web server. This shouldn't happen with users accessing your Moodle site from their own desktop or mobile device.

### Why does it show me as enrolled on the front page?

The Front Page is a course in Moodle. All users are enrolled by default in this course.

### I added the {recaptcha} tag in my web form. Why doesn't the reCAPTCHA show up?

First, the reCAPTCHA is only made to work with forms processed by the Contact Form for Moodle plugin. That said, it is 100% generated by Moodle API so, if you have some other purpose, it will probably work as well as long as the receiving form is made to process it.

In order for reCAPTCHA to work, you need to configure the site and secret keys in Moodle. For more information, log into your Moodle site as an Administrator and the navigate to Home > Site Administration > Authentication > Manage Authentication and configure the ReCAPTCHA site key and ReCAPTCHA secret key. You will also need to enable ReCAPTCHA in the settings of the Contact Form plugin.

If you are using older versions of Moodle before 3.1.11+, 3.2.8+, 3.3.5+, 3.4.5+ and 3.5+, ReCAPTCHA is no longer supported.

### How can I get the {scrape} tag to work?

You need to enable this feature in the FilterCodes settings in Moodle.

### How can I scrape content from more than one web page or more than one website?

Use multiple {scrape} tags.

### How can I scrape content based on a pattern of HTML tags instead of just one HTML tag with a class or id? Example, an h1 tag inside the div class="content" tag.

That is not possible at this time. This is a very simple scraper. With some funding or contributions, this feature can be enhanced.

### How can I get the {getstring} tag to work? It doesn't seem to be replaced with the correct text.

Verify that the component (plugin) name and/or the string key are correct. If a component name is not specified, it will default to "moodle". If you recently modified a language file manually in Moodle, you may need to refresh the Moodle cache.

### How can I customize or translate the forms generated by the {form...} tags?

See **Customizing or translating the forms generated by the {form...} tags** in the [Usage](#usage) section.

### What are the Supported dateTimeFormat formats?

The date and time formats, defined in Moodle (langconfig.php)[https://github.com/moodle/moodle/blob/master/lang/en/langconfig.php], control how dates and times will be displayed.

At this time, only the following formats are supported:

* backupnameformat
* strftimedate
* strftimedatemonthabbr
* strftimedatefullshort
* strftimedateshort
* strftimedateshortmonthabbr
* strftimedatetime
* strftimedaydate
* strftimedaydatetime
* strftimedayshort
* strftimedaytime
* strftimemonthyear
* strftimerecent
* strftimerecentfull
* strftimetime
* strftimetime12
* strftimetime24

Note: the displayed date and/or time format can vary depending on the language pack in use. While you can customize these using the Moodle language customization tool included with Moodle, be aware that this will have affect displayed dates that use the modified format throughout your Moodle site. Pro tip: Standardize the date format used throughout your site as much as possible in order to minimize the chance of potentially confusing your learners.

ALPHA WARNING: You may discover that you can also use (strftime)[https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php] formats. However, in some situations, strftime may produce undesirable results - missing unrelated content in your page for example. The strftime formats are officially unsupported at this time. This is a known issue and is not recommended at this time. Please do not report issues with it. Use strftime formats at your own risk.

### Are there any security considerations?

There are no known security considerations at this time.

### How can I get answers to other questions?
